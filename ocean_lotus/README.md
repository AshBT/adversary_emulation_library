# Ocean Lotus

Based on open-source intelligence, the [Center for Threat-Informed Defense](https://mitre-engenuity.org/cybersecurity/center-for-threat-informed-defense/) team created the below scenario based on tools and resources available at the time.

## Adversary Overview 
**Objectives:** [OceanLotus](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0050/) is a cyber threat group that began operations since 2014 and whose campaigns align with Vietnamese state interests, targeting private corporations in the manufacturing, consumer product, and hospitality sectors as well as foreign governments, political dissidents, and journalists. <sup>[1](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/cyber-espionage-apt32)</sup> OceanLotus leverages commerically available tools and custom malware to execute strategic web compromises against victim networks. Specifically, the group‚Äôs campaigns usually involve phishing and watering hole attacks, spyware, DLL side-loading, DNS tunneling, and data exfiltration. Between February 2018 and November 2020, OceanLotus launched several spyware attacks against Vietnamese human rights activists, bloggers, and nonprofit organizations, believed to be a result of the government‚Äôs efforts to censor pro-democratic rhetoric.<sup>[2](https://www.amnestyusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Click-and-Bait_Vietnamese-Human-Rights-Defenders-Targeted-with-Spyware-Attacks.pdf)</sup>

Associated Groups: APT32, SeaLotus, APT-C-00


## Emulation Overview üìñ
This scenario specifically focuses on macOS and Linux environments, starting with a compromised macOS host. OceanLotus uses a multi-phased approach in exfiltrating sensitive data from a targeted victim, by first facilitating a watering hole attack and gaining initial access to the victim's workstation. To establish persistance, the attackers disguise the OSX backdoor as a fake Word document, sent via email to the victim. When the fake document is opened, a bash script is executed in the background that performs the backdoor capabilities of collecting OS information and registering with their C2 server. OceanLotus then searched for ssh keys and known host files, moving laterally to a discovered Linux server.<br>
