    * If the execution fails, check your PATH for `C:\Program Files\dotnet`
* Nuget packages for .NET
  * The default .NET installation does not download these packages even if
    your host is connected to the internet, so manually downloading these is
    necessary.
  * ![ASP.NET Core Runtime 6.0.5](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App.Runtime.win-x64/6.0.5)
    * Downloads as `microsoft.aspnetcore.app.runtime.win-x64.6.0.5.nupkg`

### Build Prerequisites - Setting Up the Build Directory

* Ensure that the download.iso file is in the same directory as the Makefile and iso.cs file.

## Compile the Executable

First, build the executables with static compilation:

```
make build-all
```

The executables are placed in `build/`.


Create an archive to hold the executable:

```
make archive
```

The archive will be `bypass.zip`.
